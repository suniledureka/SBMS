What is GraphQL?
----------------

- Graph Query Language

- Graph - collection of objects & their connections; usually drawn as nodes & lines - Database entity diagram, Class Diagram etc
- QL - Query Language - SQL 

SQL Vs GraphQL
SQL 	-> (1) For database (2) relational database (3) specific library/ driver  (4) SQL Syntax
GraphQL -> (1) For API through Internet (2) Any storage  (3) HTTP & JSON (4) GraphQL Syntax

- GraphQL is a query language for your API - used in backend server

- It is open-source data query and manipulation language for API

- GraphQL is an API query language and a server-side runtime for querying and updating the existing data stored in any kind of data storage.

- Like SQL - here we use query to fetch the data. You have the flexibility to which data to fetch
  select * from employee;
  select empno,ename from employee;

- Query to fetch the data and Mutation to alter the data (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE method mappings)

- Like REST APIs we can use GraphQL with different programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, PHP etc
- It was initially developed by Facebook and later moved to open source GraphQL Foundation. 

- Unlike traditional REST APIs, where the server determines the data you receive, GraphQL allows clients to request only the specific data they need.

- It is an alternative to REST and other web service architectures.


What is GraphQL Query?

- GraphQL Query is used to fetch the data from the backend
- We can compare it with GET REST APIs
- While working with Java, GrpahQL provides GraphQLQueryResolver interface (we use this in our spring boot application to create our query)

What is GraphQL Mutation?
- GraphQL Mutation is used to alter the data; ie- Create, Update , Delete data
- We can compare it with POST, PUT, DELETE REST APIs
- GraphQLMutationResolver is provided 

What is GraphQL Schema?

- GraphQL Schema provides flexibility to consumers that which attributes they want in response. (In REST API we have fixed response, GraphQL have got flexibility by providing schema)
- It is a separate file with .graphqls file extension (.gqls)
- Schema defines which attributes are there in your class with data types
  Example: Student.java - id, firstName, lastName, email, street, city etc

- Contract between Consumer and Provider on how to get and alter the data for the application
- Schema is a collection of GraphQL types. 
  Query and Mutation are root types in schema ie entry point for the application

Example: schema for Student class will as follows

type Student {
	id : Long
	firstName : String
	lastName : String
	email : String
	street : String
	city : String  //we can remove it; if so then consumer may not be getting city value 
}


Graphql Vs REST APIs

1) REST is having fixed response while GraphQL provides flexibility to consumers that which attributes they want in response
  - as an example -in REST API which exposes 10 fields to consumer- every consumer will get the same 10 fields in the response for that API. In GraphQL - different consumers can ask for different set of fields in response
  select * from student; - like REST 
  select id, firstName, lastName from student; - like Graphql
  select firstName, lastName from student; -- like GraphQL

2) Overfetching and Underfetching with REST API- when we are trying to access an endpoint and we need one property from that endpoint - but it returns the complete data
	underfetching - we cannot combine multiple endpoint datas (1 endpoint is fetching firstName of student and 2nd endpoint is fetching lastName of student - consumer wants to get both firstName and lastName - so the consumer have to fetch both APIs)
	select firstName from student;
	select lastName from student
	select firstName, lastName from student; //GraphQL

3) REST has different HTTP methods and separate endpoint for each API (we provide different URIs and the entry point will be the rest controller; in GraphQL we wont be having rest controller) while in GraphQL we have Query and Mutation and there will be only one endpoint - all calls will come to this endpoint only

4) GraphQL needs Schema file while REST does NOT need that

Chrome - Altair GraphQL Client
query{
 student(id: 1){
   id
   firstName
 }
}

query{
 student(id: 1){
   id
   firstName
   lastName
 }
}

query{
 student(id: 1){
   firstName
   city
 }
}

Setting up Spring Boot Application with GraphQL

Netflix DGS - Domain Graph Service

1) Create a New Spring Boot Application 
 Dependencies : Spring Web, Spring for GraphQL, Dev Tools
  Spring for GraphQL - Build GraphQL applications with Spring for GraphQL and GraphQL Java.

2) Writng First Query in GraphQL

@Controller
public class Welcome {
 @QueryMapping
 public String welcomeQuery() {
  return "Welcome to GraphQL";
 }
}


-- In REST we have got separate endpoint (URI) for each and every operation where  as for GraphQL we wont be having it. In graphQL we have got only one URL for our application, all request are HTTP POST methods

3) Define GraphQL Schema - to define the class to be used, properties and methods
src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls

type Query {
 welcomeQuery: String
}

welcomeQuery - method name without any arguments and it returns String

spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true
spring.graphql.schema.locations=/graphql-schema
spring.graphql.schema.file-extensions=*


4) Run Query with GraphQL & Spring Boot
 - Run the Application
 - Open browser  - http://localhost:8080/graphiql
     query{
 	 welcomeQuery
     }
 - Altair GraphQL Client Extension - Chrome
 - Postman - POST - https://localhost:8080/graphql

Movie Application

1) New Spring Starter Project : 03.sb-graphql
Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring for GraphQL

Defining the GraphQL schema - The first step is to define the schema for our GraphQL API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). 
The schema defines the operations that can be performed on the data and the types of data that can be returned by those operations.

2) create "schema.graphqls" in the src/main/resources/graphql

Our application will have a type: Movie 

A movie has an ID, a title, a release year, a list of genres (category), and a director. 

We can define the schema for our GraphQL API in schema.graphqls as follows:

type Movie {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  year: Int!
  genres: [String!]!
  director: String!
}


GraphQL supports the scalar types out of the box: ID, String, Int, Float, Boolean
The ID type is used for unique identifiers, while the ! after the type name indicates that the field is non-nullable.


3) Generating data for our GraphQL schema

GraphQL doesn't care where data comes from. It can be a database, a cache, or any other data source. Here we will keep the data in memory, as arrays.

public record Movie(Integer id, String title, int year, List<String> genres, String director) {}

4) Create Repositories

@Repository
public class MovieRepository {
    private List<Movie> mockMovies;
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void initializeMockMovies() {
        mockMovies = new ArrayList<Movie>(List.of(        		
                new Movie(1, "The Matrix", 1999, List.of("Action", "Sci-Fi"), "The Wachowskis"),
                new Movie(2, "The Matrix Reloaded", 2003, List.of("Action", "Sci-Fi"), "The Wachowskis"),
                new Movie(3, "The Matrix Revolutions", 2003, List.of("Action", "Sci-Fi"), "The Wachowskis"))
        );
    }

    public Movie getById(Integer id) {
        return mockMovies.stream().filter(movie -> movie.id().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
    }

    public void addMovie(Movie movie) {
        mockMovies.add(movie);
    }
}

5) Writing queries and mutations

define the queries and mutations that will be exposed by our GraphQL API. Queries fetch data; mutations modify data.

in schema.graphqls

type Query {
  movieById(id: ID!): Movie
}

type Mutation {
  addMovie(
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    year: Int!
    genres: [String]!
    director: String!
  ): Movie
}

The movieById query takes an ID argument and returns a Movie. 

The addMovie mutation takes ID, title, year, genre(s), and director as arguments and returns a Movie.

6) Create controllers

@Controller
public class MovieController {
    private final MovieRepository movieRepository;

    public MovieController(MovieRepository movieRepository) {
        this.movieRepository = movieRepository;
    }

    @QueryMapping
    public Movie movieById(@Argument Integer id) {
        return movieRepository.getById(id);
    }

    @MutationMapping
    public Movie addMovie(@Argument Integer id, @Argument String title, @Argument Integer year, @Argument List<String> genres, @Argument String director) {
        Movie movie = new Movie(id, title, year, genres, director);
        movieRepository.addMovie(movie);
        return movie;
    }
}

We use @QueryMapping and @MutationMapping to map the queries and mutations to their respective methods. 
The @Argument annotation is used to bind the method argument to the GraphQL query or mutation argument.

the name of the method matches the name of the query or mutation. 
We cann use the @QueryMapping annotation with a custom method name:

@QueryMapping(name = "movieById")
public Actor findMovieById(@Argument Integer id) {
   return movieRepository.getById(id);
}


7) Configurations

GraphQL has a built-in playground that we can use to test the API. Enable it by adding the following property to the application.properties file:

spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true

8) Run the application & Test the application

http://localhost:8080/graphiql

query {
  movieById(id: 1) {
    id
    title
    year
    genres
    director
  }
}

In case a client doesn't need all the fields of a movie, it can select only a subset. 
For example, if we only need the title and the year of a movie, we can modify the query to look like this:

query {
  movieById(id: 4) {
    title
    year
  }
}


a mutation to add a new movie:

mutation {
  addMovie(
    id: 4
    title: "Inception"
    year: 2010
    genres: ["Action", "SciFi"]
    director: "Christopher Nolan"
  ) {
    id
    title
    year
    genres
    director
  }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------
adding a new Query to fetch all movies

-- in schema 
type Query {
  movieById(id: ID!): Movie
  allMovies: [Movie!]!
}

-- in repository
   public List<Movie> getAllMovies(){
    	return mockMovies;
    }

-- in controller
    @QueryMapping(name = "allMovies")
    public List<Movie> findAllMovies() {
        return movieRepository.getAllMovies();
    }

-- testing
query {
  allMovies {
    id
    title
    year
    director
  }
}

Movie & Actor Application

type Actor {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  movies: [Movie!]!
}


public record Actor(Integer id, String name, List<Movie> movies) {}

@Repository
public class ActorRepository {

    private List<Actor> mockActors;
    private MovieRepository movieRepository;

    public ActorRepository(MovieRepository movieRepository) {
        this.movieRepository = movieRepository;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    private void initializeMockActors() {
        mockActors = new ArrayList<>(List.of(
                new Actor(1, "Keanu Reeves",  List.of(movieRepository.getById(1), movieRepository.getById(2), movieRepository.getById(3))),
                new Actor(2, "Laurence Fishburne", List.of(movieRepository.getById(1), movieRepository.getById(2), movieRepository.getById(3))))
        );
    }

    public Actor getById(Integer id) {
        return mockActors
                .stream()
                .filter(actor -> actor.id().equals(id))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    }
}


in schema.graphqls

type Query {
  movieById(id: ID!): Movie
  allMovies: [Movie!]!
  actorById(id: ID!): Actor
}


@Controller
public class ActorController {

    private final ActorRepository actorRepository;

    public ActorController(ActorRepository actorRepository) {
        this.actorRepository = actorRepository;
    }

    @QueryMapping
    public Actor actorById(@Argument Integer id) {
        return actorRepository.getById(id);
    }
}



@QueryMapping(name = "actorById")
public Actor findActorById(@Argument Long id) {
   return actorRepository.getById(id);
}


testing
query {
  actorById(id: 1){
    id
    name
    movies {
      id
      title
      year
      director
    }
  }
}

Spring for GraphQL - Pagination

Pagination is a key concept for managing data requests in GraphQL and other web APIs. 
By breaking up the data into smaller, more manageable chunks, pagination ensures that GraphQL API requests are optimized for efficiency. 
It also ensures that we are not simultaneously overloading our services with too much data.

Pagination enhances the user experience by breaking down content into bite-sized portions, making navigating the data easier.

Pagination Approach 
(1) Offset based Pagination - Offset-based pagination is a simpler and more traditional approach to pagination. It relies on specifying the number of items to fetch and the dataset’s starting position (offset).

In REST API - GET /items?limit=20&offset=100
In GraphQL - 
query items {
  items(limit: 20, offset : 100) {
  ...
  }
}

(2) Cursor-Based Pagination - Cursor-based pagination, also known as keyset pagination, is a technique that uses a unique identifier or cursor to paginate through a dataset. Rather than relying on offsets or page numbers, cursor-based pagination provides a more reliable and efficient way to navigate data.

In REST API 
//Initial Request
GET /items?limit=20
//Subsequent request
GET /items?limit=20&after_id=ABC345

In GraphQL:

#Initial Request
query items {
  items(first: 20) {
  ...
  }
}
#Subsequent request
query items {
  items(first: 20, after : "ABC345") {
  ...
  }
}
